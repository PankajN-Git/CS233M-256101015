This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a **Two-Road Traffic Light Controller**, which is a **Moore Finite State Machine (FSM)**. The FSM is designed to manage the traffic flow for a two-way intersection with a specific, repeating timing sequence.


### Files

  * **`traffic_light.v`**: The synthesizable Verilog module for the traffic light FSM.
  * **`tb_traffic_light.v`**: The self-checking testbench to verify the module's behavior.
  * **`traffic_light.vcd`**: The waveform dump file generated by the simulation.


### Functionality & Deliverables

The controller's goal is to manage traffic for North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) roads with the following timing sequence:

  * NS Green: 5 ticks
  * NS Yellow: 2 ticks
  * EW Green: 5 ticks
  * EW Yellow: 2 ticks

The FSM transitions from one state to the next based on a `tick` input, which simulates a 1 Hz clock. The outputs (`ns_g`, `ns_y`, etc.) are directly determined by the current state, confirming its Moore FSM design.

The deliverables include:

  * A state diagram showing the four phases and their tick-based transitions.
  * A waveform confirming the specified durations (5/2/5/2 ticks).
  * A README that explains how the `tick` signal is generated and verified.

### Compile, Run, and Visualize Steps

To compile, run, and view the simulation results, follow these steps:

1.  **Compile** the Verilog files using Icarus Verilog. You must include both the module and testbench files.
    ```bash
    iverilog -o aim.out tb_traffic_light.v
    ```
2.  **Run** the simulation. This will execute the testbench and generate the waveform file `traffic_light.vcd`.
    ```bash
    vvp sim.out
    ```
3.  **Visualize** the waveforms using GTKWave to confirm the correct state transitions and timings.
    ```bash
    gtkwave traffic_light.vcd
    ```
